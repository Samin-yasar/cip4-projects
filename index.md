# **Code in Place Projects Index**

Welcome to my repository for all projects completed during the Code in Place v4 (CiP4) course. This index serves as a central hub to navigate through the different assignments and their respective documentation.

Each project folder contains its source code and a detailed README.md file that documents the project's purpose, functionality, and how to run it. This repository is a showcase of my learning journey and a record of the computational concepts I explored.
