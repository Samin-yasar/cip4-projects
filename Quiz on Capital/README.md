# **Capital Cities Quiz Game**

## **üó∫Ô∏è Project Description**

This is a command-line quiz game built in Python that tests your knowledge of countries and their capital cities. The game features multiple difficulty levels, a scoring system, life management, and streak bonuses to provide an engaging and challenging experience. You can play in either a normal (country to capital) or reverse (capital to country) mode, with hints and skips available to help you along the way.

## **‚ú® Features**

* **Multiple Difficulty Levels:** Choose from Easy, Medium, and Hard modes, each with unique rules, point values, and lives.  
* **Dynamic Question Modes:** Questions are randomly presented in both "normal" (country to capital) and "reverse" (capital to country) formats.  
* **Scoring & Streaks:** Earn points for correct answers and receive a bonus for answering questions correctly in a row.  
* **Life System:** Start with a set number of lives and lose one for each incorrect answer. The game ends when you run out of lives.  
* **Hints & Skips:** Use a limited number of hints to reveal the first letter of the answer or skip a question you don't know.  
* **High Score Tracking:** Your highest score is saved to a file, so you can always try to beat your personal best.
